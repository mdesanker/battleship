Battleship game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Live demo [here](https://mdesanker.github.io/battleship/)

One of the challenges I had with this project was trying to find a way to use factory methods to modify objects in the parent scope without passing the object into the method.

Learned :

- Practice using Jest for testing
- Practice using babel to allow ES6 Imports/Exports with Jest

Next steps:

- Develop AI for computer
- Make code DRY-er
